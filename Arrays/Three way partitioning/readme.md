Given an array of size n and a range [a, b]. The task is to partition the array around the range such that array is divided into three parts.
1) All elements smaller than a come first.
2) All elements in range a to b come next.
3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.

Note: The generated output is 1 if you modify the given array successfully.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5
array[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
[a, b] = [1, 2]
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
One possible arrangement is: {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. If you return a valid arrangement, output will be 1.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 6 
array[] = {1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1}
[a, b] = [1, 3]
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
One possible arrangement is: {1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 6}. If you return a valid arrangement, output will be 1.
