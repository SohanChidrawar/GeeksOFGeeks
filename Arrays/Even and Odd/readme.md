Given an array arr[] of size N containing equal number of odd and even numbers. Arrange the numbers in such a way that all the even numbers get the even index and odd numbers get the odd index.
Note: There are multiple possible solutions, Print any one of them. Also, 0-based indexing is considered.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {3, 6, 12, 1, 5, 8}
Output:
1
Explanation:
6 3 12 1 8 5 is a possible solution.
The output will always be 1 if your
rearrangement is correct.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output :
1
